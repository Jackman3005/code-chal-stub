# Quickli code challenge stub

Here is a working code base we've prepared for you. You should be able to stick in some environment variables and deploy it to Vercel to get it going in 5-10 minutes.

## What's next?

You should sus it out before you start the challenge. We've kept the project as simple as possible so it's easy to extend.

Let us know when you're ready to start the challenge and we'll email it to you at the start of the 3 hour block.

## Key technologies

This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app` and is composed of the following:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
- [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org) (I fiddled about to get a bodgy version of credential auth working so that you don't need to worry about hooking up any oauth providers)
- [Prisma](https://prisma.io)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- [tRPC](https://trpc.io)

## How do I hook up a db

We've used a free mongodb instance (from mongo atlas) while spinning this up, but feel free to plug it into any database you want.
